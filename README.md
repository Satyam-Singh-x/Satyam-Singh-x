# 💫 About Me:
I am a Machine Learning and Generative AI enthusiast with a strong interest in building intelligent, end-to-end AI systems, supported by a solid foundation in core ML concepts, mathematics, and practical implementation. I am currently pursuing a degree in Chemical Engineering, while actively developing advanced skills in applied AI and machine learning.<br><br>I began with classical Machine Learning, covering algorithms, feature engineering, model evaluation, and complete ML pipelines, and built multiple end-to-end projects to apply these concepts in real scenarios.<br><br>I then transitioned into Deep Learning, developing an in-depth understanding of ANN, CNN, RNN, and LSTM architectures, focusing on internal model behavior rather than treating models as black boxes. This foundation was further extended to Transformer architectures and attention-based models.<br><br>In Computer Vision, I worked with OpenCV and object detection paradigms, studying RCNN-based models and YOLO, and implemented vision-based applications from concept to deployment.<br><br>My Generative AI journey includes extensive work with LLMs and LangChain, with strong understanding of chains, tools, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and Agentic RAG using Agno. This involved document indexing, embeddings, and vector-based retrieval pipelines, including a domain-specific RAG system for Chemical Engineering knowledge. I have also learned the core concepts of the Model Context Protocol (MCP) and built local MCP servers, including a finance-tracking MCP server, enabling structured and tool-driven LLM interactions.<br><br>I further specialized in Agentic AI, working with LangGraph, Agno, CrewAI, and Gemini-based agents, and gained hands-on experience in graph-based workflows, tool orchestration, and multi-agent systems. Notably, I designed a multi-agent system modeled as a data-science team, where specialized agents collaborate on analysis, reasoning, and task execution.<br><br>I also work with local LLM inference using Ollama, focusing on efficient, API-independent AI systems. To bridge AI with production, I use FastAPI to expose ML models as APIs and collaborate with web developers. I am currently strengthening my Data Structures and Algorithms in Python to build efficient and scalable AI systems.<br><br>I am actively seeking Machine Learning / AI / Generative AI internship opportunities.
